# Portfolio

Code included in this repository is for my professional website located at [www.rafaellabbe.com](http://rafaellabbe.com/)
It features custom CSS and JavaScript while taking advantage of jQuery, AJAX, and JSON for quickly updating the page without reloads. The site is fully functional and is mobile responsive.

# Structure

The file structure is straightforward using modern conventions.
- img - Images organized by page.
- js - jQuery library and custom JavaScript.
- css - Styling files.
- inc - Header, footer, nav, and email sending PHP code.
- files - Any file available for download on the site including booklets, resume, and downloadable portfolio pdf.
- json - JSON files referenced for pages and portfolio pieces to be displayed.
- pages - PHP files for each page available on portfolio site.

# JSON

Each JSON file contains a "listed" and "unlisted" section allowing one to easily hide or include pages.
The projects file is called when the page loads and when the screen resizes while the rwc file is called when the RWC page is loaded in.
