	<h2>The Stages of Neuroblastoma</h2>
		<p>The treatment a child receives for neuroblastoma depends on the risk group assigned. Risk is determined by age, tumor characteristics (pathology and genetics), and stage--the extent to which the disease has spread. Disease stage is determined according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS), developed in 1988 and last revised in 1993. The staging system is currently under revision by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) task force. The diagnostic tests listed above help doctors assign the child's disease to one of the following INSS stages (percentages of each stage are taken from North America data on 1253 neuroblastoma cases):</p>
