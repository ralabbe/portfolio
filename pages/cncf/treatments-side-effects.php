	<h2>Neuroblastoma Treatments and side effects</h2>
		<p>The treatment approach for neuroblastoma depends on the stage of the cancer, the child's age, and other factors such as the prognostic markers mentioned above. The types of treatment used may include:</p>

      	<p>Surgery can be used both to help diagnose neuroblastoma and to treat it. For smaller tumors that have not spread, surgery is often the only treatment that is needed.</p> 
<h5><b>Surgical (open) biopsy</b></h5>
<p>Before treatment begins, doctors may do a surgical biopsy to remove tumor samples to be looked at under a microscope and for other lab tests. If the tumor is in the abdomen, the surgeon may do the biopsy with the aid of a laparoscope. This is a long, thin tube with a tiny video camera on the end. It is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision to allow the surgeon to see inside. The surgeon then makes a second small incision to reach inside the abdomen with long, thin instruments and remove a small piece of tumor. </p>
<h5><b>Surgery as treatment</b></h5>
<p>After neuroblastoma is diagnosed, surgery is often used to try to remove as much of the tumor as possible. In some cases, surgery can remove the entire tumor and bring about a complete cure. During the operation, the surgeon looks carefully for signs of tumor spread to other organs. Nearby lymph nodes are removed and looked at under a microscope for cancer cells. If possible, the surgeon will remove the entire tumor. This is less likely to be possible if the tumor is wrapped around large blood vessels. Even if the tumor cannot be completely taken out, treatment with chemotherapy (and sometimes radiation therapy) after removing most of the cancer may result in a cure. Sometimes surgery is repeated after other treatments (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) to check the results of therapy and to remove any remaining cancer if possible. If the tumor is very big, chemotherapy may be used before surgery. This can shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove completely.</p> 
<h5><b>Possible risks and side effects of surgery</b></h5>
<p>Like all forms of treatment, surgery poses some risk of complications. These can include reactions to anesthesia, excess bleeding, and damage to blood vessels, kidneys, other organs, or nerves. Most complications are minor, but serious ones are possible. Complications are more likely if the tumor is large and growing into blood vessels or nerves.</p>

      	<p>Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs. They are most often administered by IV or directly into a vein. The drugs enter the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body to reach and destroy cancer cells. This makes chemotherapy useful for treating neuroblastoma that has spread to the lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, lungs, or other organs. </p>

<p>Some cases of neuroblastoma are treated with chemotherapy along with surgery, either before (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or after (adjuvant chemotherapy). In other cases, especially when the cancer has spread too far to be completely removed by surgery, chemotherapy is the primary treatment.</p>

<p>Most children with neuroblastoma will need chemotherapy. In most cases, chemotherapy treatment involves a combination of medicines. The main drugs used to treat children with neuroblastoma include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
	<li>Cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide</li>
	<li>Cisplatin or carboplatin</li>
	<li>Vincristine</li>
	<li>Doxorubicin (Adriamycin)</li>
	<li>Etoposide</li>
	<li>Topotecan</li>
</ul><br />
<p>The most common combination of drugs used to treat neuroblastoma consists of carboplatin (or cisplatin), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide, but others may be used. For children in the high-risk group, larger combinations of drugs are used, and the drugs are given at higher doses, which may be followed by a stem cell transplant (see below). </p>

<h5>Possible side effects of chemotherapy </h5>
<p>Chemotherapy drugs work by attacking cells that are dividing quickly, making them effective against cancer cells. The downside But other cells in the body, such as those in the bone marrow, the lining of the mouth and intestines, and the hair follicles, also divide quickly. These cells are also likely to be affected by chemotherapy, which can lead to side effects. </p>

<p>Children seem to have an advantage over adults when it comes to chemotherapy. They tend to have less severe side effects and recover from side effects more quickly. One benefit of this is that doctors can give high doses of chemotherapy that are necessary to kill the tumor. </p>

<p>The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the type and dose of drugs given and the length of time they are taken. General side effects of chemotherapy drugs can include:</P>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
	<li>Hair loss</li>
	<li>Mouth sores</li>
	<li>Loss of appetite</li>
	<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
	<li>Increased chance of infections (due to low white blood cell counts)</li>
	<li>Easy bruising or bleeding (due to low blood platelet counts)</li>
	<li>Fatigue (due to low red blood cell counts)</li>
</ul><br />

<p>Most side effects are short-term and disappear after treatment is completed. In addition, many side effects can be lessened through a number of techniques. There are ways to lessen many common treatment side effects. For example, drugs can be given to help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting. Be sure to discuss any questions you have about side effects with the cancer care team.</p>

<p>Along with the possible side effects listed above, some side effects are specific to certain medicines: <p>

<p>Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide can damage the bladder. This can be avoided or minimized by giving the drugs with plenty of fluids and with a drug called mesna, which helps protect the bladder. These drugs can also damage the ovaries or testicles and may affect fertility (the ability to have children). </p>

<p>Doxorubicin can cause heart damage. Doctors try to reduce this risk as much as possible by not giving more than the recommended doses of doxorubicin and by checking the heart with a test called an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) during treatment. This drug can also cause skin damage if it should leak out of the vein during administration. </p>

<p>Cisplatin and carboplatin can affect the kidneys. Giving plenty of fluids can help reduce this risk. These drugs can also affect hearing in some cases. Your child's doctor may check this with hearing tests (audiograms) during or after treatment. </p>

<p>Vincristine can damage nerves. Some patients may notice tingling and numbness, particularly in the hands and feet. </p>

<p>Chemotherapy can also have longer-term side effects in some cases. For example, some drugs used to treat neuroblastoma can increase the risk of later developing a cancer of white blood cells known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While this is a serious risk, it is not common, and the importance of chemotherapy in treating neuroblastoma far outweighs this risk.</p>

        <p>Retinoids are chemicals that are related to vitamin A. They are known as differentiating agents because they are thought to help some cancer cells to mature (differentiate) into normal cells. </p>

<p>In children with high-risk neuroblastoma, treatment with a retinoid called 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin) reduces the risk of recurrence after high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. Most doctors now recommend 6 months of 13-cis-retinoic acid (taken as a capsule) once therapy is completed. </P>

<p>Researchers are now trying to develop more effective retinoids and to define the exact role of this approach in the treatment of neuroblastoma.</p>

<h5>Possible Side Effects: </h5>
<p>The most common side effect of 13-cis-retinoic acid is drying and cracking of the lips. Dry skin or eyes are also possible, as are nosebleeds and changes in the nails.</p>

<p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays or particles to kill cancer cells. Radiation is sometimes a necessary part of treatment, but because of the possible long-term side effects in children, it is avoided when possible. Two types of radiation therapy can be used to treat children with neuroblastoma.</P>
<h5>External Beam Radiation Therapy</h5>
<p>This type of radiation therapy focuses radiation on the cancer from a source outside the body. There are several situations in which this type of radiation therapy might be used: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
  <li>To destroy neuroblastoma cells that remain behind after surgery and chemotherapy</li>
  <li>To try to shrink tumors before surgery, making them easier to remove at the time of surgery</li>
  <li>To treat larger tumors that are causing serious problems (such as trouble breathing) and do not respond quickly to chemotherapy</li>
  <li>As part of the treatment regimen (along with high-dose chemotherapy) before a stem cell transplant in children with high-risk neuroblastoma</li>
  <li>To help relieve pain caused by advanced neuroblastoma</li>
</UL><BR />
<p>The radiation is typically directed at the tumor itself, but in some cases it may also target other parts of the body to reduce the risk of cancer spread. When radiation is delivered throughout the body, it is known as total body irradiation (TBI). External radiation therapy is much like getting an x-ray, but the radiation is more intense. The procedure itself is painless. </p>

<p>Before treatments start, the radiation team takes careful measurements with imaging tests such as MRI scans to determine the correct angles for aiming the radiation beams and the proper dose of radiation. Each actual treatment lasts only a few minutes, but the setup time – getting your child into place for treatment – usually takes longer. Young children may be given medication to make them fall asleep so they will not move during the treatment. Most often, radiation treatments are given 5 days a week for several weeks. </p>

<h5>Possible Side Effects</h5>
<p>Short-term side effects of external radiation therapy may include mild skin reactions, nausea, diarrhea, or fatigue. Often these go away after a short while. Talk with your child’s doctor about these side effects because there are ways to relieve some of them. Radiation may also make the side effects of chemotherapy worse. </p>
<p>Radiation therapy can interfere with the growth of normal body tissues, and may increase the risk of developing other cancers later on. The actual effects depend on the part of the body getting radiation.</p> 
<h5>MIBG radiotherapy</h5>
<p>MIBG is a chemical similar to norepinephrine, which is made by sympathetic nerve cells. A slightly radioactive form of MIBG is sometimes injected into the bloodstream as part of an imaging test to look for neuroblastoma cells in the body. </p>

<p>A more highly radioactive form of MIBG is also used to treat some patients with advanced neuroblastoma, often along with other treatments. Once injected into the bloodstream, the MIBG goes to the sites of tumors anywhere in the body, where it delivers its radiation. The child will need to stay in a special room for a few days after the injection until most of the radiation has left the body. </p>

<h5>Possible Side Effects</h5>
<p>MIBG therapy can sometimes cause nausea and vomiting. It can also lower blood cell counts because of its effects on the bone marrow. In rare cases it may cause high blood pressure for a short period of time. MIBG may build up in the thyroid gland in the neck, which can sometimes result in low levels of thyroid hormone in the body.</P>      </div>

<p>This type of treatment is used in children with high-risk neuroblastoma who are unlikely to be cured with other treatments. It involves giving high doses of chemotherapy (higher than could safely given otherwise) and/or radiation therapy (total body irradiation or high-dose MIBG), and then replacing the body’s bone marrow cells, which were killed by the treatment. In the past, this type of treatment was commonly referred to as a bone marrow transplant. </p>

<p>The bone marrow is the soft, inner part of some bones where new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are formed. Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body. White blood cells are part of the immune system, which fights off infections. Platelets are needed to stop bleeding caused by cuts and scrapes. </p>

<p>Both chemotherapy and some types of radiation can affect blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow. (These are the cells that make the different types of blood cells.) Even though more intensive treatments might be more effective in treating tumors, they can’t be given because they would cause severe damage to the bone marrow, leading to life-threatening shortages of blood cells. </p>

<p>Doctors try to get around this problem by giving the child an infusion of blood-forming stem cells after treatment. This is known as a peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). </p>
<h5>What It Involves</h5>
<p>The first step in a PBSCT is to collect, or “harvest,” the child’s own blood-producing stem cells to use later. In the past, the stem cells were often taken from the child’s bone marrow, which was done by drilling small holes in certain bones. But doctors have found that these cells can be taken from the bloodstream during a procedure known as apheresis. This is similar to donating blood, but instead of going into a collecting bag, the blood goes into a special machine that filters out the stem cells and returns the other parts of the blood back to the person’s body. The stem cells are then frozen until the transplant. </P>

<p>After the harvest, the child gets high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation. When treatment is complete, the patient’s stem cells are thawed and returned to the body in a process similar to a normal blood transfusion. The stem cells travel through the bloodstream and settle in the bone marrow. Over the next 3 or 4 weeks, the stem cells start to make new, healthy blood cells in the child’s bone marrow. </p>

<p>Until this happens, the child is at high risk of infection because of a low white blood cell count, as well as bleeding because of a low platelet count. To avoid infection, protective measures are taken, such as using special air filters in the hospital room and having visitors wear protective clothing. Blood and platelet transfusions and treatment with IV antibiotics may also be used to prevent or treat infections or bleeding problems. </P>

<p>A peripheral blood stem cell transplant is a complex treatment. If the doctors think your child may benefit from a transplant, the best place to have this done is at a nationally recognized cancer center where the staff has experience in performing the procedure and managing the recovery period. </p>

<p>A stem cell transplant is also very expensive and often requires a lengthy hospital stay. Because the procedure is so expensive, you should have an idea of how the costs might be covered beforehand. Be sure to get a written approval from your insurer if the procedure is recommended for your child. </p>

<h5>Possible Side effects</h5>
<p>Possible early complications and side effects are basically the same as those caused by any other type of high-dose chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and are due to damage to the bone marrow and other quickly dividing tissues of the body. They can include low blood cell counts (with increased risk of infection and bleeding), nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, mouth sores, and hair loss. </P>

<p>One of the most common and serious short-term effects is an increased risk for infection. Antibiotics are often given to try to prevent this from happening. Other side effects, like low red blood cell and platelet counts, may require blood product transfusions or other treatments. </P>

<p>Some complications and side effects can persist for a long time or may not occur until years after the transplant. Be sure to talk to your child’s doctor before the transplant to learn about possible long-term effects your child may have.</p>       </div>
