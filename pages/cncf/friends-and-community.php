	<h2>CNCF Friends and Community</h2>
	<p>Neuroblastoma has a profound impact on the children battling this devastating disease and the families that love them. However, it also deeply affects the friends and community where they live. It’s difficult to know how to help families during the many phases of neuroblastoma diagnosis, treatment and beyond. On these pages you will find ideas on what you can do to support them and make a difference. It will take a village to find a cure for neuroblastoma and save the lives of the children that battle courageously against it. We encourage you to join CNCF in creating more awareness for this aggressive and devastating form of pediatric cancer and making neuroblastoma a top research funding priority. Hope unites and inspires us.</p>
